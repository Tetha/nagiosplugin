## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project and run `bundle install` to resolve all development dependencies.
* Add specs and/or features for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Commit, do not mess with the Rakefile or gemspec
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
